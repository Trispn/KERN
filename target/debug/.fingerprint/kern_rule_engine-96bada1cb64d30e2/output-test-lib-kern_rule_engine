In most cases this can be provided\nby adding a type annotation. Sometimes you need to specify a generic type\nparameter manually.\n\nIn the example above, type `Vec` has a type parameter `T`. When calling\n`Vec::new`, barring any other later usage of the variable `x` that allows the\ncompiler to infer what type `T` is, the compiler needs to be told what it is.\n\nThe type can be specified on the variable:\n\n```\nlet x: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();\n```\n\nThe type can also be specified in the path of the expression:\n\n```\nlet x = Vec::<i32>::new();\n```\n\nIn cases with more complex types, it is not necessary to annotate the full\ntype. Once the ambiguity is resolved, the compiler can infer the rest:\n\n```\nlet x: Vec<_> = \"hello\".chars().rev().collect();\n```\n\nAnother way to provide the compiler with enough information, is to specify the\ngeneric type parameter:\n\n```\nlet x = \"hello\".chars().rev().collect::<Vec<char>>();\n```\n\nAgain, you need not specify the full type if the compiler can infer it:\n\n```\nlet x = \"hello\".chars().rev().collect::<Vec<_>>();\n```\n\nApart from a method or function with a generic type parameter, this error can\noccur when a type parameter of a struct or trait cannot be inferred. In that\ncase it is not always possible to use a type annotation, because all candidates\nhave the same return type. For instance:\n\n```compile_fail,E0282\nstruct Foo<T> {\n    num: T,\n}\n\nimpl<T> Foo<T> {\n    fn bar() -> i32 {\n        0\n    }\n\n    fn baz() {\n        let number = Foo::bar();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis will fail because the compiler does not know which instance of `Foo` to\ncall `bar` on.

{"$message_type":"diagnostic","message":"type annotations needed","code":{"code":"E0282","explanation":"The compiler could not infer a type and asked for a type annotation.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0282\nlet x = Vec::new();\n```\n\nThis error indicates that type inference did not result in one unique possible\ntype, and extra information is required. In most cases this can be provided\nby adding a type annotation. Sometimes you need to specify a generic type\nparameter manually.\n\nIn the example above, type `Vec` has a type parameter `T`. When calling\n`Vec::new`, barring any other later usage of the variable `x` that allows the\ncompiler to infer what type `T` is, the compiler needs to be told what it is.\n\nThe type can be specified on the variable:\n\n```\nlet x: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();\n```\n\nThe type can also be specified in the path of the expression:\n\n```\nlet x = Vec::<i32>::new();\n```\n\nIn cases with more complex types, it is not necessary to annotate the full\ntype. Once the ambiguity is resolved, the compiler can infer the rest:\n\n```\nlet x: Vec<_> = \"hello\".chars().rev().collect();\n```\n\nAnother way to provide the compiler with enough information, is to specify the\ngeneric type parameter:\n\n```\nlet x = \"hello\".chars().rev().collect::<Vec<char>>();\n```\n\nAgain, you need not specify the full type if the compiler can infer it:\n\n```\nlet x = \"hello\".chars().rev().collect::<Vec<_>>();\n```\n\nApart from a method or function with a generic type parameter, this error can\noccur when a type parameter of a struct or trait cannot be inferred.

{"$message_type":"diagnostic","message":"the trait bound `Value: Copy` is not satisfied","code":{"code":"E0277","explanation":"You tried to use a type which doesn't implement some trait in a place which\nexpected that trait.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0277\n// here we declare the Foo trait with a bar method\ntrait Foo {\n    fn bar(&self);\n}\n\n// we now declare a function which takes an object implementing the Foo trait\nfn some_func<T: Foo>(foo: T) {\n    foo.bar();\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // we now call the method with the i32 type, which doesn't implement\n    // the Foo trait\n    some_func(5i32); // error: the trait bound `i32 : Foo` is not satisfied\n}\n```\n\nIn order to fix this error, verify that the type you're using does implement\nthe trait. Example:\n\n```\ntrait Foo {\n    fn bar(&self);\n}\n\n// we implement the trait on the i32 type\nimpl Foo for i32 {\n    fn bar(&self) {}\n}\n\nfn some_func<T: Foo>(foo: T) {\n    foo.bar(); // we can now use this method since i32 implements the\n               // Foo trait\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    some_func(5i32); // ok!\n}\n```\n\nOr in a generic context, an erroneous code example would look like:\n\n```compile_fail,E0277\nfn some_func<T>(foo: T) {\n    println!(\"{:?}\", foo); // error: the trait `core::fmt::Debug` is not\n                           //        implemented for the type `T`\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // We now call the method with the i32 type,\n    // which *does* implement the Debug trait.\n    some_func(5i32);\n}\n```\n\nNote that the error here is in the definition of the generic function. Although\nwe only call it with a parameter that does implement `Debug`, the compiler\nstill rejects the function. It must work with all possible input types. In\norder to make this example compile, we need to restrict the generic type we're\naccepting:\n\n```\nuse std::fmt;\n\n// Restrict the input type to types that implement Debug.\nfn some_func<T: fmt::Debug>(foo: T) {\n    println!(\"{:?}\", foo);\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // Calling the method is still fine, as i32 implements Debug.\n    some_func(5i32);\n\n    // This would fail to compile now:\n    // struct WithoutDebug;\n    // some_func(WithoutDebug);\n}\n```\n\nRust only looks at the signature of the called function, as such it must\nalready specify all requirements that will be used for every type parameter.\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"kern-rule-engine\\src\\lib.rs","byte_start":18652,"byte_end":18656,"line_start":480,"line_end":480,"column_start":25,"column_end":29,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"            registers: [None; 16],","highlight_start":25,"highlight_end":29}],"label":"unsatisfied trait bound","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"the trait `Copy` is not implemented for `Value`","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[{"file_name":"kern-rule-engine\\src\\lib.rs","byte_start":1376,"byte_end":1390,"line_start":50,"line_end":50,"column_start":1,"column_end":15,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"pub enum Value {","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":15}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":null},{"message":"required for `Option<Value>` to implement `Copy`","code":null,"level":"note","spans":[],"children":[],"rendered":null},{"message":"the `Copy` trait is required because this value will be copied for each element of the array","code":null,"level":"note","spans":[],"children":[],"rendered":null},{"message":"create an inline `const` block","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[{"file_name":"kern-rule-engine\\src\\lib.rs","byte_start":18652,"byte_end":18652,"line_start":480,"line_end":480,"column_start":25,"column_end":25,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"            registers: [None; 16],","highlight_start":25,"highlight_end":25}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":"const { ","suggestion_applicability":"MachineApplicable","expansion":null},{"file_name":"kern-rule-engine\\src\\lib.rs","byte_start":18656,"byte_end":18656,"line_start":480,"line_end":480,"column_start":29,"column_end":29,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"            registers: [None; 16],","highlight_start":29,"highlight_end":29}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":" }","suggestion_applicability":"MachineApplicable","expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"\u001b[1m\u001b[91merror[E0277]\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[97m: the trait bound `Value: Copy` is not satisfied\u001b[0m\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[96m--> \u001b[0mkern-rule-engine\\src\\lib.rs:480:25\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[96m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[96m480\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[96m|\u001b[0m             registers: [None; 16],\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[96m|\u001b[0m                         \u001b[1m\u001b[91m^^^^\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[91munsatisfied trait bound\u001b[0m\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[96m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[96mhelp\u001b[0m: the trait `Copy` is not implemented for `Value`\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[96m--> \u001b[0mkern-rule-engine\\src\\lib.rs:50:1\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[96m|\u001b[0m\n \u001b[1m\u001b[96m50\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[96m|\u001b[0m pub enum Value {\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[96m|\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[96m^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\u001b[0m\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[96m= \u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[97mnote\u001b[0m: required for `Option<Value>` to implement `Copy`\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[96m= \u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[97mnote\u001b[0m: the `Copy` trait is required because this value will be copied for each element of the array\n\u001b[1m\u001b[96mhelp\u001b[0m: create an inline `const` block\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[96m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[96m480\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[96m| \u001b[0m            registers: [\u001b[92mconst { \u001b[0mNone\u001b[92m }\u001b[0m; 16],\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[96m|\u001b[0m                         \u001b[92m+++++++\u001b[0m      \u001b[92m+\u001b[0m\n\n"}
